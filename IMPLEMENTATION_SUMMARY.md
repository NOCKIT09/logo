### SQLite Schema ✅
```sql
tickets (
  id, name, phone UNIQUE, email, code UNIQUE, 
  status, approved INTEGER, 
  createdAt, updatedAt, 
  ipHash, deviceId, userAgent
)

proofs (
  id, codeOrSession, platform, filePath, createdAt
)

prizes (
  id, title, type, description, imageUrl, 
  quantity, weight, createdAt
)

redemptions (
  id, ticketCode, prizeId, prizeSnapshotJson, 
  phone, ipHash, deviceId, createdAt
)
```

### File Storage ✅
- Local filesystem under `/public/uploads/`
